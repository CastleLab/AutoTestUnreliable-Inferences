# AutoTestUnreliableInferences

This repo contains the code and the public dataset for *Automated Testing of DNN Models for Unreliable Inferences*

## Install Dataset
We have prepared an [One Drive Link](https://hkustconnect-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/mlick_connect_ust_hk/EWawiF0sbNRIgjhJYX5ep0kB11moVRkZwN3HjGW60ijeOg?e=Qrtsco) to access the EgoHands dataset.

To use it, please download the dataset, rename it to "images" and put it under `./Tools/data_egohands/`

## Acknowledgment
