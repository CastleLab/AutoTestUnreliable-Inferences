# AutoTestUnreliableInferences

This repo contains the code and the public dataset for *Automated Testing of DNN Models for Unreliable Inferences*

## Install Dataset
The EgoHands dataset is stored at `./Tool/data_egohands/images`. To use it, please keep it under `./Tool/data_egohands/`.

### Other datasets
Our method can also be applied to other datasets like [ImageNet](https://image-net.org) and [MS COCO](https://cocodataset.org/#home).

## Acknowledgment
This work is supported by the Hong Kong ITF (Grant No: MHP/055/19) *Testing DNN Systems*.

### Dataset
We would like to thank the [IU Computer Vision Lab](http://vision.soic.indiana.edu/projects/egohands/) for providing the EgoHands dataset.
We would also like to thank the http://roboflow.com for preprocessing the EgoHands dataset.


### Tools
We would also like to thank Redmon et al for providing the [darknet](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/) tool to help us train the YoloV3 model.
